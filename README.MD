# 2024 Advent of code
## Written in js because I'm not a real developer

I'm not good enough to speedrun this, or do it in an esoteric language or on a BBC Micro. I'm not even good enough to finish all 25 days. I just want to see how far I can get.

**Day 1:** Threw it together in 5 minutes, and ran it in devtools because I'm lazy and already 2 days behind. Will write some proper tooling later.
