# 2024 Advent of code
## Written in js because I'm not a real developer

I'm not good enough to speedrun this, or do it in an esoteric language or on a BBC Micro. I'm not even good enough to finish all 25 days. I just want to see how far I can get.

**Day 1:** Threw it together in 5 minutes, and ran it in devtools because I'm lazy and already 2 days behind. Will write some proper tooling later. 

**Day 2:** A pain the hole, got stuck on a really weird edge case that had me off me off by one with damping. What if removing a value caused the direction of the levels to change? Fuck is what happens. Fuck.

**Day 3:** Nice straight forward regex, I really need to get better at regex as a rule, thankfully these were just pattern hunts with no real logic to it. Spent more time soothing typescript because regexes can always return null. People who forbid non null assertion in their linting rules will face judgement.
